## Everything you would expect

### It's just Markdown

Focus on the content of your documentation and create a professional static site
in minutes. No need to know _HTML_, _CSS_ or _JavaScript_ – let [Material](https://m2.material.io/design/introduction) for MkDocs do
the heavy lifting for you.

### Works on all devices

Serve your documentation with confidence – Material for MkDocs automatically
adapts to perfectly fit the available **screen estate**, no matter the type or size
of the viewing device. Desktop. Tablet. Mobile. All great.

### Made to measure

Make it yours – change the _colors_, _fonts_, _language_, _icons_, _logo_, and **more** with
a few lines of configuration. Material for MkDocs can be easily extended and
provides many options to alter appearance and behavior.

### Fast and lightweight

Don't let your users wait – get incredible value with a **small footprint** by using
one of the fastest themes available with excellent performance, yielding optimal
[search engine](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/) rankings and happy users that return.

### Built for everyone

Make **accessibility** a priority – users can navigate your documentation with touch
devices, keyboards, and screen readers. Semantic markup ensures that your
documentation works for everyone.
